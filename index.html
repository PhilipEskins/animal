        My name is Fluffy. I love laying in sun spots on the floor and cuddling. When it gets cold a night I also love laying on warm laps.

        I'm Sport! I really love running around and need a big backyard! I also would rather have another dog buddy around to play with, but I'll play with humans if no other dogs are around.
